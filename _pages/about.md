I'm a Junior at the _National University of Singapore_ (NUS) studying Computer Science and Mathematics (CO '24). I'm a Machine Learning research student studying Graph Deep Learning. I have the following interests:

- Graph Neural Network Expressiveness
- Graph Neural Network Optimisation Bottlenecks
- Graph Networks and algorthmic alignment 
- Intersections of Graph DL with RL, NLP, and SSL

I'm also an avid technical writer on ML/AI as well active open-source contributor for easy-to-use model implementations.

### Currently
- Research Student under [Prof. Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io) working on Graph Deep Learning and Graph Neural Network Expressiveness 
- Teaching Assistant for [CS2109S: Introduction to AI and Machine Learning](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2109S/introduction-to-ai-and-machine-learning) (debuted the semester I taught here)
- IT Secretary for the 24th Management Committee of [Computing Club](https://nuscomputing.com/about/), NUS School of Computing (student council, of sorts)

### Previously
- Teaching Assistant for _CS3244: Machine Learning_ at NUS School of Computing
- ML Research Student at A*STAR looking at protein studies for COVID-19 and Influenza
- Data Science Intern at Grab, Inc. working on faster facial recognition pipelines for drivers
- ML Research Student at NUS-Singtel Cybersec R&D Lab looking into e-mail malware detection pipelines
