I'm an undergrad at the _National University of Singapore_ (NUS) studying Computer Science and Mathematics (CO '24). I work on Geometric Deep Learning for Molecular Biology and Cheminformatics, advised by Prof. Bryan Hooi.

I'm an incoming research student at [I2R, ASTAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r), working on Geometric Deep Learning for the Open Catalyst Problem.

I'm also an avid writer on ML/AI as well as an active open-source contributor for easy-to-use model implementations and wrappers. Find my CV [here](https://rish-16.github.io/cv/).
