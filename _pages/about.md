I'm a Junior at the _National University of Singapore_ (NUS) studying Computer Science and Mathematics (CO '24). I'm a Machine Learning research student specialising in (applied) Graph Deep Learning. I have the following interests:

- Graph Representation Learning (molecules, proteins, text, etc.)
- Graph Semi-supervised Learning
- Attention and (Graph) Transformers
- GNN Expressiveness (general interest)

I'm also an avid technical writer on ML/AI as well as an active open-source contributor for easy-to-use model implementations and wrappers. Find my CV [here](https://rish-16.github.io/cv/).
