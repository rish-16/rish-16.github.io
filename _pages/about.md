I'm an undergrad at the _National University of Singapore_ (NUS) studying Computer Science and Mathematics (CO '24). I'm a Machine Learning research student specialising in (applied) Graph Deep Learning. I have the following interests:

- Graph Representation Learning (molecules, proteins, text, etc.)
- Graph Semi-supervised Learning
- Attention and (Graph) Transformers
- GNN Expressiveness (general interest)

I'm also an avid technical writer on ML/AI as well as an active open-source contributor for easy-to-use model implementations and wrappers. Find my CV [here](https://rish-16.github.io/cv/).

### Currently
- Research Student under [Prof. Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io) at NUS working on efficient Graph Representation Learning for molecules
- (Incoming) Research Student at ASTAR, Singapore working on Graph Deep Learning for the Open Catalyst Problem

### Previously
- Research student at _OpAL Lab, University of Waterloo_ working on Graph Attention methods
- Teaching Assistant for _CS2109s: Introduction to AI and Machine Learning_ at NUS Computing
- Teaching Assistant for _CS3244: Machine Learning_ at NUS Computing
- ML Research Student at _ASTAR_ looking at protein studies for COVID-19 and Influenza
- Data Science Intern at _Grab_ working on faster facial recognition pipelines for drivers
- ML Research Student at _NUS-Singtel Cybersec R&D Lab_ looking into e-mail malware detection pipelines
