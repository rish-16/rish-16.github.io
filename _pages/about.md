I'm a Junior at the _National University of Singapore_ (NUS) studying Computer Science and Mathematics (CO '24). I'm a Machine Learning research student studying Graph Deep Learning. I have the following interests:

- Applied Graph DL (molecules, text, etc.)
- Graph Representation Learning
- Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning
- (Graph) Attention and Transformers

I'm also an avid technical writer on ML/AI as well as an active open-source contributor for easy-to-use model implementations and wrappers.

### Currently
- Research student under [Prof. Kimon Fountoulakis](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/people-profiles/kimon-fountoulakis) at the _OpAL Lab, University of Waterloo_ working on Graph Attention methods
- Research Student under [Prof. Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io) at NUS working on efficient Graph Representation Learning on molecules
- (Incoming) Research Student at ASTAR, Singapore working on Graph Deep Learning for the Open Catalyst Problem

### Previously
- Teaching Assistant for _CS2109s: Introduction to AI and Machine Learning_ at NUS School of Computing
- Teaching Assistant for _CS3244: Machine Learning_ at NUS School of Computing
- ML Research Student at A*STAR looking at protein studies for COVID-19 and Influenza
- Data Science Intern at Grab, Inc. working on faster facial recognition pipelines for drivers
- ML Research Student at NUS-Singtel Cybersec R&D Lab looking into e-mail malware detection pipelines
