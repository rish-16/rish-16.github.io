Hey! I'm Rishabh, a grad student at Yale University advised by [Rex Ying](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/ying-rex/) and [Smita Krishnaswamy](https://krishnaswamylab.org/). I'm interested in **geometric deep learning and generative modelling for drug discovery and biomolecule design**. 

Currently, I'm a research intern at Prescient Design, working on similar things for antibodies, with Pooja Mahajan and Andrew Watkins.

I graduated from the _National University of Singapore_ (NUS) with a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. I was co-advised by [Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io) and [Pietro Lio](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/). My thesis was on **generative models for _de novo_ 3D RNA backbone design**.
