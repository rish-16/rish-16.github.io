Hey! I'm Rishabh, a grad student at Yale University advised by [Rex Ying](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/ying-rex/) and [Smita Krishnaswamy](https://krishnaswamylab.org/). I'm interested in **geometric deep learning and generative modelling for drug discovery**. Stuff I find cool: biomolecule design, protein/molecular dynamics, and literally anything structural-modeling-related. I also like tinkering with LLMs occasionally.

Currently, I'm a research intern at [Prescient Design](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/prescient-design), working on similar things for antibody design, with Pooja Mahajan and Andrew Watkins. 

I graduated from the _National University of Singapore_ (NUS) with a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. I was co-advised by [Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io) and [Pietro Lio](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/). My thesis was on **generative models for _de novo_ 3D RNA backbone design**.

I'm also an avid writer on ML/AI as well as an active open-source contributor for ML tooling. Find my CV [here](https://rish-16.github.io/cv/) and blog [here](https://rish-16.github.io/year-archive/). Here's my [Standing invitation](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/) to reach out ;)
