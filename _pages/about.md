I'm an undergrad at the _National University of Singapore_ (NUS) studying Computer Science and Mathematics (CO '24). I work on Geometric Deep Learning for Molecular Biology and Cheminformatics, advised by [Prof. Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io). I enjoying working at the fascinating intersection of AI for Science!

I will soon be joining [I2R, ASTAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r) to study on Geometric Deep Learning for Electrocatalysis as part of the [Open Catalyst Project](https://opencatalystproject.org). I'm fortunate to have Dr. Li Xiaoli and Dr. Edwin Khoo as supervisors.

I'm also an avid writer on ML/AI as well as an active open-source contributor for ML tooling. Find my CV [here](https://rish-16.github.io/cv/) and blog [here](https://rish-16.github.io/year-archive/).
