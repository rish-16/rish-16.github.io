I'm a Year 2 at the National University of Singapore (NUS) studying Computer Science and Pure Mathematics (CO '24). I'm also part of the NUS University Scholars Program (USP).

I'm a Machine Learning research student with an interest in Graph Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Computer Vision. I'm also an active technical writer, open-source contributor, and ML consultant. Since 2015, I've been dabbling with Deep Learning at various startups and research institutions.

### Currently
- Research Student under [Prof. Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io) working on Graph Deep Learning and Expressiveness 
- Teaching Assistant for [CS2109S: Introduction to AI and Machine Learning](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2109S/introduction-to-ai-and-machine-learning) (debuted the semester I taught here)
- IT Secretary for the 24th Management Committee of [Computing Club](https://nuscomputing.com/about/), NUS School of Computing (student council, of sorts)

### Previously
- Teaching Assistant for **CS3244: Machine Learning** at NUS School of Computing
- ML Research Student at A*STAR looking at protein studies for COVID-19 and Influenza
- Data Science Intern at Grab, Inc. working on faster facial recognition pipelines for drivers
- ML Research Student at NUS-Singtel Cybersec R&D Lab looking into e-mail malware detection pipelines

### Usually
I'm found jamming on my electric guitar ðŸŽ¸ or scrolling through memes. Oh, and I like collecting tech swag and laptop stickers/decals (200+ and counting!).
