I'm an undergrad at the _National University of Singapore_ (NUS) studying Computer Science and Mathematics (CO '24). I work on geometric deep learning for molecular biology and cheminformatics, advised by [Prof. Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io). I enjoying working at the fascinating intersection of AI4Science!

I'm currently at [I2R, ASTAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r) studying geometric deep learning and generative modelling for protein engineering. I'm fortunate to have Dr. Li Xiaoli and Dr. Edwin Khoo as supervisors.

I'm an incoming Visiting Researcher at the University of Cambridge (UK) studying geometric deep learning for protein dynamics and molecular interactions under the guidance of [Prof. Pietro Lio](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) and Prof. Bryan Hooi.

I'm also an avid writer on ML/AI as well as an active open-source contributor for ML tooling. Find my CV [here](https://rish-16.github.io/cv/) and blog [here](https://rish-16.github.io/year-archive/).
