I'm a final-year undergrad at the _National University of Singapore_ (NUS) studying Computer Science and Mathematics (CO '24). I work on geometric deep learning and generative modeling for biology and chemistry problems, co-advised by [Prof. Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io) and [Prof. Pietro Lio](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/). I enjoy working at the fascinating intersection of AI4Science!

I'm also an avid writer on ML/AI as well as an active open-source contributor for ML tooling. Find my CV [here](https://rish-16.github.io/cv/) and blog [here](https://rish-16.github.io/year-archive/).
