I'm a Junior at the _National University of Singapore_ (NUS) studying Computer Science and Mathematics (CO '24). I'm a Machine Learning research student studying Graph Deep Learning. I have the following interests:

- Graph Neural Network Expressiveness
- Graph Neural Network Optimisation Bottlenecks
- Graph Networks and algorthmic alignment 
- Intersections of Graph DL with RL, NLP, and SSL

I'm also an avid technical writer on ML/AI as well active open-source contributor for easy-to-use model implementations and wrappers.

### Currently
