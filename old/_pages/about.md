Hey! I'm Rishabh, a grad student at Yale University advised by [Rex Ying](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/ying-rex/) and [Smita Krishnaswamy](https://krishnaswamylab.org/). I'm interested in **geometric deep learning and generative modelling for drug discovery**. Stuff I find cool: biomolecule design, protein/molecular dynamics, and literally anything structural-modeling-related. I also like LLMs and Mechanistic Interpretability.

I graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) with a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. I was co-advised by [Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io) and [Pietro Lio](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/). My thesis was on **generative models for _de novo_ 3D RNA backbone design**.

I write about life and a bunch of random seemingly-unconnected things ([old blog](https://rish16.notion.site/aea001f7f32548acb068a9bb3971c97d?v=7e86063471c84a4b81694c11f511aa36), [new blog](https://rishflections.substack.com/)) and ML/AI/tech ([tech blog](https://rishtech.substack.com/)), and am also an active open-source contributor for ML tooling ([github](https://github.com/rish-16)).

Find my CV [here](https://rish-16.github.io/cv/) and blog [here](https://rish-16.github.io/year-archive/). Don't hesitate to reach out if you find any of this cool ;)
